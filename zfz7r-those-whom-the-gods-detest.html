There is something about the atmosphere of that game I really like. I spent a lot of time in that level. Another game that I love is Blood by Monolith, which has incredible atmosphere. I think at the time it was intended for a 386 or 486, so these days the game runs on even the shittiest of systems. A lot of the games that come out now look great but aren't necessarily fun.

I also will do likewise.’ You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way; for every abominat. 
Review Summary: "Those Whom the Gods Detest may replace In Their Darkened Shrines as the indispensable Nile album" In the genre of musical defilement, called technical death metal, standing out in any way is already an achievement in itself. Band after band shows up on stage. I remember that in my childhood I had very rough pretensions about what would happen when I was fifteen.
